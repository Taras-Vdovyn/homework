    <p><i> The Lockheed SR-71</b> "Blackbird" is a long-range, high-altitude, strategic reconnaissance aircraft
            developed and manufactured by the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. It was operated by both
            the United States Air Force (USAF) and NASA.</i></p>

    <p>The <b>SR-71</b> was developed as a black project from the Lockheed <b>A-12</b> reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by
        Lockheed's Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was responsible for many
        of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the <b>SR-71</b> was based on that of the <b>git A-12</b>, which was one of
        the first aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber variant of the
        aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for
        the reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne radar, and a photo
        camera; the <b>SR-71</b> was both longer and heavier than the <b>A-12</b>, allowing it hold more fuel as well as a two-seat
        cockpit. The <b>SR-71</b> designation has been attributed to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis
        LeMay, who preferred the <b>SR</b> (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply <b>RS</b> (Reconnaissance). The aircraft
        was introduced to operational service in January 1966...</p>
